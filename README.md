Year 3 Lab - A1 Photoelectric Effect

Python scripts to analyse I-V curves of light at various frequencies incident on a Leybold cell, connected to variable voltage source and Keithley picoammeter.
Uses various methods to extract stopping voltage, then plots against frequencies of incident light to obtain value for Planck's constant h.
